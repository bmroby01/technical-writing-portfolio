# Brianna Roby - Technical Writing Portfolio

## About Me

With 8 years of experience in the tech field, I have held diverse roles such as technical support agent, backend developer, QA engineer, and QA Lead. Each position has allowed me to develop a wide range of skills, and as a lifelong learner, I have relished the opportunity to expand my knowledge and expertise in various areas.

The skill I have honed the most is technical writing, which has always come naturally to me due to my long-standing passion for writing. Over the course of my career, I have crafted blog posts, API documentation, how-to articles, internal documentation, and more. Additionally, I have developed a keen interest in recording video tutorials, further broadening my skill set.

Although I have never held the official title of Technical Writer, my extensive experience on software development teams, leadership in a Documentation Guild, and creation of tutorials have all prepared me for my desired role in technical writing. I am excited to bring my comprehensive experience and passion for clear, effective communication to a Technical Writer position.
